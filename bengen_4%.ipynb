    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

    "This notebook describes the case of Sam, a fictitious individual used for demonstrating the conditions required for the so-called 4% rule. This case considers no pension, no social security benefits, just a portfolio of a tax-deferred account with 50% stocks and 50% bounds. This scenario is then tested to survive sequences of historical rates, particularly the ones which happened in 1966.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article that popularized the 4% rule is from William Bengen (Journal of Financial Planning, October 1994). The scenario consists of looking at the longevity of a 50% common stocks and 50% intermediate-term Treasury notes portfolio under a variety of withdrawal rates and depending on the historical year that the individual started her retirement. Cases considered consisted of withdrawal rates from 1% to 6%, to be determined on the balance of a single tax-deferred account at the first year of retirement and then be indexed for inflation. These scenarios highlight the effect of sequence of returns through using historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original claim is that a withdrawal rate of 4% of the portfolio at the first year of retirement would be sustainable for a 30-year retirement period. These withdrawals are then adjusted for inflation and no income tax is considered. To avoid triggering the income tax machinery in ARP Lab, we will use an unrealistically small amount of \\\\$2k per year to be withdrawn from a single \\\\$50k tax-deferred account. As this scenario is meant to explore the effects of a percentage, multiplying all the numbers by 20 will convert the results of withdrawing \\\\$40k from a \\\\$1M portfolio. This can obviously be done for any other portfolio balance of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Bengen used data from Ibbotson's SBBI (Stocks, Bonds, Bills, Inflation) Yearbook while the data used in ARP Lab is from the NYU Stern business school. There will be slight discrepancies in the number of years that the accounts can sustain due to the slight difference in the rates used. As a results, the investment portfolios in ARP Lab last a little shorter than those originally obtained by Bengen. The trends and conclusions are the same however."

Using commutativity of multiplication, one can easily demonstrate that there is no point in doing a Roth conversion if the tax rate to be paid on the conversion now is the same as the one to be paid on the distribution later. However, things are much more complex in reality, and one has to take RMDs in consideration on top of all other unknown factors that can happen, including changes in the tax code. For this purpose, a simple heuristical Roth optimizer maximizes the estate amount left at the passing of the last spouse, considering a tax bracket on the taxable portion of the estate, and under the constraint of receiving a desired income.
