    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

    "In this short notebook, we will explore the subtle effects of Roth conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common argument made about Roth conversions is that their benefits only depend on the tax rate now vs. the tax rate in the future. Mathematically, we have an amount of savings $A$ in a tax-deferred account yielding an average annual return rate $r$ over $n$ years. The nominal value of our savings at year $n$ will be denoted $A_n$, and can be expressed as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A_n = A (1 + r)^n. $\n",
    "\n",
    "If we withdraw $A_n$ after $n$ years, it will be subject to a tax rate $t_n$. Let's call this net amount $B_n$ obtained after withdrawing the money and paying income tax on it,\n",
    "\n",
    "$B_n = A_n (1 - t_n) = A (1 + r)^n (1 - t_n).$\n",
    "\n",
    "If on the other hand, we convert the money today at a tax rate \\$t_0\\$, we would invest $A (1 - t_0)$ in a tax-free account that would grow at the same rate $r$ during $n$ years. The resulting amount $B'_n$ would then be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$B'_n = A (1-t_0) (1 + r)^n = A (1+r)^n (1-t_0).$\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two last equations, it should be clear that if $t_0 = t_n$, then $B_n = B'_n$ due to the commutative property of multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common conclusion drawn from this argument is that unless the tax rate today is smaller than the tax rate in the future, i.e., unless $t_0 < t_n$, which would imply that $B'_n > B_n$, then there is no benefit in performing a Roth conversion. It is often argued that the income at retirement will be lower than during active life, and therefore the tax rate will be lower in retirement, provided the tax code stays as it is. However, speculations about future tax rates, some of which having some merit, are then brought up. For example, it is observed that the historical income tax rates in the US are not sustainable given the mandatory spending of the US government, especially regarding an aging population. To support this point, historical data on income tax rates are shown to support the hypothesis that tax rates are likely to increase in the future. The following figure shows how marginal tax rates have decreased during the last 50 years, as a supporting evidence that an increase of income tax are likely in the future.\n",
    "![US historical income tax rate](images/USIncomeTaxMarginalRates.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is wrong with this argument? Nothing. The argument is valid, the assumptions are not. Here are the hidden assumptions:\n",
    "- The rate of return $r$ is constant in time. **It is obviously not.**\n",
    "- The income at retirement is likely to be less than during one's active life, and therefore income taxes during retirement will be lower. **This is not the case if the required minimum distributions (RMDs) are large.** This is particularly true for individuals having large tax-deferred accounts.\n",
    "- The rate of return in a tax-deferred account is the same as the one in a tax-free account. **Not necessarily, in fact they shouldn't be.** For tax and risk management, the distribution of assets in these accounts should definitely not be the same as both withdrawals and investments from and in these accounts should be coordinated. An easy strategy is to keep the high-risk/high-reward assets in the tax-free account, which is likely to be depleted last, and put the less volatile assets in the tax-deferred account. This means that $r$ for the tax-deferred account will definitely not be the same as the one for the tax-free account.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARP Lab is not free of assumptions. Future tax rates are known until 2025. For after 2025, we assume that the tax code of 2017 becomes active after the expiration of the TCJA (expiring in 2025). Income brackets are indexed for inflation, which rate is speculated through the rates selected (e.g., historical, fixed, or statistical) by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's investigate this in more detail by using a few specific examples. We will be using historical data and a heuristic Roth optimizer. Note that this optimizer is not trying to get the maximum income during retirement. Instead, it tries to maximize the estate under the constraint that the desired net income will be matched. Because Clyde and Bonnie have sufficient assets, they believe that they can live comfortably while leaving some money to their heirs. The goal is therefore to maximize the estate, under the assumption that a certain income tax rate will apply when heirs withdraw the money from the tax-deferred account. This rate is not an estate tax, it is an income tax rate on the tax-deferred portion of the estate."

    "Note how the Roth conversions are timed with the spikes in rates of return, reinforcing the practice that making Roth conversion during the downturns of the market is an excellent strategy. Here, the Roth conversions are assumed to be done early in the year, before the annual rate of return is applied. As a results, conversions in the same year as when the market recovers is the best strategy. As we do not know when the market will bounce, we do know when the market goes down, and therefore a strategy of converting any time during a market large dip is good. Maybe a guardrail approach could be investigated.\n",

    "Another contributing factor to this additional wealth is that when tax-deferred assets are large, the RMDs can have a significant tax impact in the middle-to-late years of retirement. Roth conversion smooths out these income peaks by shifting the tax burden earlier in the retirement and avoiding large RMDs later in life. Moreover, coordinated accounts can maintain a balanced portfolio while shifting high-performance (but riskier) assets to a tax-free account, further reducing the tax burden on the remaining assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When return rates are constant, the proposed Roth conversions will tend to align with a given tax bracket (dashed lines), following common wisdom. The situation here is a combination of both, as it seems advantageous to break the tax bracket line for generating more return in a tax-free account before a swing of market recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that this simulation is using average annual return rates and not daily rates. This has two consequences. The first one is that a knowledge of daily market values could lead to even more gains. But this is only wishful thinking. Second, this simulation assumes that conversions happen at the beginning of the year. A practical implementation would be to design a guard rail system in which a drop in the market beyond a certain percentage value could trigger a Roth conversion of a certain amount optimized over informed assumptions."

    "I hope this example have convinced you that Roth conversions have complex implications and should be considered for reasons beyond those strictly comparing the current tax rate with possible tax rates of the future. The effects of large RMDs, heirs income tax on estate, and market fluctuations need to be considered.\n",

    "- What is the effect of the tax-deferred tax rate assumed? Does a rate of 30% give the same answer as 20%? How about 60%? At what percentage will optimized scenarios have the tax-deferred accounts all be converted by the time that Clyde and Bonnie have passed?\n",
    "- What is the effect of a *smile* spending profile vs a *flat* spending profile?\n",
    "- What if both spouses have large tax-deferred assets?\n",
    "- What are the benefits of accounts allocations in this case? What if accounts allocations are not coordinated?\n",
    "- What happens if a different historical starting year other than 1969 is selected? Are the effects as significant?\n",
