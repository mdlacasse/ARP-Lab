    "This package is a retirement modeling framework for exploring the sensitivity of retirement financial decisions. Strictly speaking, it is not a planning tool, but more an environment for exploring *what if* scenarios. It provides different realizations of a financial strategy. One can certainly have a savings plan, but due to the volatility of financial investments, it is impossible to have a certain asset earnings plan. This does not mean one cannot make decisions. These decisions need to be guided with an understanding of the sensitivity of the parameters.This is exactly where this tool fits it. Given your savings and spending desires, it can generate different future realizations of your strategy under different market assumptions, helping to better understand your financial situation.\n",

More taxes could be paid, if this leads to more wealth for the heirs conditional to satisfying a desired net income during the life span of Clyde and Bonnie. Is there a preferable sequence of conversions when markets are fluctuating? To answer this question, we will use the sequence of historical rates that happened from 1969 and the years after. Are there signs in the market that can indicate preferable times to make a Roth conversion? Let's run this case. We will use the `%%time` option of Jupyter to report the computer time to run the case. We will assume a tax rate of 25% to be applied to the tax-deferred portion left in the estate after Clyde and Bonnie have passed. This is done to be able to make meaningful comparisons between end-of-life portfolios that have a mix of tax-deferred and tax-free assets."

    "Note how the Roth conversions are timed with the spikes in rates of return, reinforcing the practice that making Roth conversion during the downturns of the market is an excellent strategy. Here, the Roth conversions are assumed to be done early in the year, before the annual rate of return is applied. As a results, conversions in the same year as when the market recovers is the best strategy. As we do not know when the market will bounce, we do know when the market goes down, and therefore a strategy of converting any time during a market large dip is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "When tax-deferred assets are large, the RMDs can have a significant tax impact in the middle-to-late years of retirement. Roth conversion smooths out these income peaks by shifting the tax burden earlier in the retirement and avoiding large RMDs later in life. Moreover, coordinated accounts can maintain a balanced portfolio while shifting high-performance (but riskier) assets to a tax-free account, further reducing the tax burden on the remaining assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When return rates are constant, the proposed Roth conversions will tend to align with a given tax bracket (dashed lines), following common wisdom. The situation here is a combination of both, as it seems advantageous to break the tax bracket line for generating more return in a tax-free account before a swing of market recovery."
